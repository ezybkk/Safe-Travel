    Name: 'Oriental Spice Gourmet',
    Details:
      'Oriental Spice Gourmet or OSG is an Asian restaurant. Although it is located along the Basak-Marigondon Road, the restaurant is very easy to miss. Thatâ€™s because aside from the indeterminate acronym plastered across the restaurant facade, there is very little indication that it is, in fact, a restaurant. What makes OSG extra special is the fact that they serve nothing but authentic Southeast Asian dishes. In fact, the restaurant encourages its guests to call before actually proceeding to the restaurant as the owners frequently travel outside the country to buy ingredients and other things needed to operate the restaurant. (Note: They are also closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.)',
